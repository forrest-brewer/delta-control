    "# $\\Sigma\\Delta$ Stream Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Sigma\\Delta$ Stream Computation is a strategy for implementing low complexity, low power, low latency, continuous time performance controllers in digital logic. The control implementation strategy does this by directly processing high resolution, high bandwidth $\\Sigma\\Delta$ encoded bitstreams. Both inputs and outputs can be encoded as sigma-delta bitstreams leading to inexpensive hardware realizations. This also allows direct connection between $\\Sigma\\Delta$ converters and the controller hardware without need to perform parallel data conversion and thus eliminates the associated overhead and latency.\n",

    "## Why not Shift-Based LTI?\n",
    "\n",
    "As the sampling period approaches zero, the poles of the filters converge to z=1 on the unit circle in the complex plane. In fixed point realizations where the coefficients of a filter are represented with finite precision, the possible locations of filter poles in the unit circle stability region of the Z domain become sparse in and around the real axis. The figure illustrates this effect for a fourth order lowpass filter while increasing the sample rate from 1kHz to 10kHz. As can be seen the poles and zeros converge quickly. What is more disturbing is that the black dots represent the quantization points for 5 bit coefficients in the filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that z=1 is not a possible location within the unit circle for complex conjugate poles with distinct complex components. As sampling rates increase, discerning between distinct complex conjugate poles requires larger coefficient bitwidths leading to ever expanding logic implementations. Without, large coefficient bitwidths, the filter will experience severe filter magnitude and phase response deviations as well as the potential for instability. It seems counter intuitive that as the sample rate increases the numerical stability of the fixed point filter implementation decreases.\n",
